Phase 3 Code Challenge: Python Fundamentals
Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Phase 3 Code Challenge focusing on Python Fundamentals. The challenge includes tasks related to basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

Contents
Functions:

add_numbers(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers.
is_even(number): Determines if a number is even.
reverse_string(text): Reverses a given string.
count_vowels(text): Counts the number of vowels in a string.
calculate_factorial(n): Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.
apply_decorator(func): Applies a decorator that prints 'Decorator Applied' before calling the function.
Sequences:

sort_by_age(list_of_tuples): Sorts a list of tuples by age in ascending order.
Sets and Dictionaries:

merge_dicts(dict1, dict2): Merges two dictionaries and sums values for common keys.
Object-Oriented Programming:

Car class: Represents a car with make, model, and year attributes and a method to display the car's information.
